## A/B testing and SQL queries for e-learning

In this project I explore results of a recent A/B test concerning a new payment mechanism on an e-learning platform. I select key metrics, conduct statistical tests to determine the new feature's fate. Aside from checking for significant differences in the readings, I calculate the product's key metrics using Clickhouse.
The analysis led me to believe that the new feature didn't influence the KPIs, positively or negatively, so it would be unwise to roll out the new payment mechanic.
